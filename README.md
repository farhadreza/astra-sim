### What is this repository for? ###
This is the ASTRA-sim DNN training simulator. 

The full description of the tool and its strength could be found in the paper below:

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Go to gem5/ directory
2. Run: "./my_scripts/build_Garnet_standalone.sh" to build it
3. Go to runs/ directory
4. Run: "./sampleDLRM_a2a.sh runName" where runName is an arbitrary name you choose for this specific run
5. After sim finish, go to ../results/runName-a2a directory, the detailed and EndToEnd csv files for this run are stored there (times are in microseconds in the csv files)

NOTE: you can use "./sampleDLRM_torus.sh runName" for step 5 instead. the a2a simulates on  a sample physical alltoall topology while torus simulates on top of a physical 3D torus.

NOTE: The on-screen reported delays after the end of simulation are in cycles while the delays inside the csv files are in terms of microSeconds.
